        <p>May 2000.<br>One  day, my producer Anath sends me this tune “Lady (Hear me tonight)” and  asks me to think about a music video. I listen a lot to the song, I find  it absolutely melancholic and very romantic. Sadness mixed with joy. <br>So I come up with this bitter teenager love story :<br>Three teenagers, two boys and one girl, decide to run away together, and they want to have pleasure, fun and escape reality.<br>I write it quite fast, with “Virgin Suicides” and “Boys Don’t Cry” in mind. <br>Modjo, the band is french, but they made the choice to sing to everyone in the world, in english.<br>I  am french too and I thought the video had to look the same, to be able  to talk to everyone in the world, to be the most universal possible.<br>I wanted it to look like a mix of the USA and my french suburban hometown.<br>This is how, in June 2000, we take a plane and end up in Montreal, Quebec. <br>In Montreal we organize a casting session to find our three young heroes.<br>I was looking for three teenagers with a real relationship between them, no matter if it was friendship or love.<br>That’s how we found our beautiful teenager trio, three real friends in life : Sarah-Jane, Patrice and Gilles.<br><br>In June 2000, we went on a road trip on the roads of Quebec.<br><br>Locations are listed on this page : <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1g9wR_Zo2l7lf6GkVEG8IxDYeKeg" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1g9wR_Zo2l7lf6GkVEG8IxDYeKeg<span class="sr-only"> - lien externe</span></a> </p><p><br>The band Modjo, Yann and Romain, appear in the video : they sell the car to the three teenagers. <br>This version is of course the Official version of the video. But MTV edited one shot out of the video… Do you know which one ?</p>
